  `containerEvents()`, and `testEvents()` methods, respectively. The deprecated methods
  will be removed in JUnit Platform 1.7.0.

=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `@EnabledIf` and `@DisabledIf` have been removed from Jupiter's API. Script-based
  condition APIs and their supporting implementations were deprecated in JUnit Jupiter 5.5
  with the intent to remove them in JUnit Jupiter 5.6. Users must now rely on a
  combination of other built-in conditions or create and use a custom implementation of
  `ExecutionCondition` to evaluate the same conditions.
